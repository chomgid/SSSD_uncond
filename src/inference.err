nohup: ignoring input
CUDA extension for cauchy multiplication not found. Install by going to extensions/cauchy/ and running `python setup.py install`. This should speed up end-to-end training by 10-50%
Falling back on slow Cauchy kernel. Install at least one of pykeops or the CUDA extension for efficiency.
